# My NixOs flake config.

My config is split between different folders.
In `users` you can find my user definitions and home-manager configs.
In `machines` you can find the machines configurations split by hardware specific configurations and general configurations option.
In `lib` you can find a few helper functions that i have declared. 

At the moment i only own one machine so this config might seems a bit overkill but i will own a second machine in the near future.
